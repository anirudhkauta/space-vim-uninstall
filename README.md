# space-vim-uninstall
I do not own this script. This is just my personal backup for the SpaceVim install/uninstall script.

As of Feb 2025 SpaceVim is no longer maintained and so the install/uninstall script hosted at spacevim.org no longer works.

For any wandering ex-SpaceVim users you can use the script in this repo to uninstall the script.

# I will not be maintaining the script this is only a backup!!!
